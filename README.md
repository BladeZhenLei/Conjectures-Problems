### Main Conjectures
Many of these involve large number compuation and are beyond the capacity of conventional computers, it can only be hoped that advances in additive number theory or quantum computers can help further understand such problems.

**1. Exponent of 2 and 3 Gap (2023.04.19; open)**
<br/>
For each prime of the form $2^{a}-3^{b}$, where $a>b$ and $a\neq2^k$, it suffices that $gcd(a,b)=1$.
<br/>
<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
Initial observation has identified it to be true for $a\leq10^3$. 

**2. Tower of $2$ and $3$ Sum (2022.1.19; solved)**
<br/>
Denote the tetration of an integer $a$ as ${^{n}a}=a^{a^{a^{.^{.^{.}}}}}$ where the exponent is repeated $n$ times. Other than $p_1$, $p_2$, and $p_3$, are there more primes in the form $p_n={^{n}2}+{^{n}3}=3^{3^{3^{.^{.^{.}}}}}+2^{2^{2^{.^{.^{.}}}}}$?
<br/>
<strong> Answer </strong>
<br/>
No, the frist three terms are the only primes in such pattern.
<br/>
For $n=4$, we have $21219553216129$ divides $p_4$. 
<br/>
For $n>{4}$, we have $34276387$ divides $p_5$, and in general, $4423$ divides $p_6$ or greater. 
<br/>
Note: It is impossible to calculate $p_4$ itself as it is several magnitudes bigger (3,638,334,640,024 digits) than the largest prime number human ever computed (24,862,048 digits), the first result was obtained on 2/24/2022 through exhaustive cloud computing using trial division method, it took more than a month to find the smallest divisor, which should be credited to the original author. The second incredible general case result was obtained by another author using Extended Euler's Theorem. See

**[Generalized] $2$-Tower Sum (2023.2.13; open)**
<br/>
How many primes are there in the form of ${^{n}a}+{^{n}b}$, finitely or infinitely many?
<br/>
<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
None.

**[Generalized] $N$-Tower Sum (2023.2.13; open)**
<br/>
How many prime divisors are there for all such ${^{e_1}1}+{^{e_2}2}+...+{^{e_n}n}$, where $e_{i+1}>e_{i}$, could there be only finitely many?
<br/>
<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
None.

**3. $N$-Factorial Sum (2022.10.9; open)** 
<br/>
For any integer $n\geq{1}$, is there always a prime that can be obtained from combinations of addition and subtraction of all elements in the set $\lbrace{1!, 2!, 3!, â€¦, n!}\rbrace$? 
Such as
$p_1={1!}\pm{0!},$
$p_2={2!}\pm{1!},$
$p_3={3!}\pm{2!}\pm{1!},$
$\cdots,$
$p_n=n!\pm(n-1)!\pm(n-2)!\pm(n-3)!\pm\cdot\cdot\cdot\pm{1!}.$
<br/>
<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
This statement reamins true for $p_{1}$ to $p_{257}$ and likely to be true for all positive integers. Considering the prime density around $n!$ with such combination shoud be $\frac{2^{n-1}}{nlog(n)}>1$.

**[Specified] $2$-Factorial Sum (2022.10.10; open)**
<br/>
For any given $n\in{N}$, let $k\in{Z}$ such that $n\geq{k}\geq{1}$, define $S=\lbrace{n!}\pm{k!}\pm{1}\rbrace\cap{P}$, is $S^c$ a finite set?
<br/>
<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
The known examples are only $n=\lbrace{63, 161, 382, 902}\rbrace$ for $n\leq1250$.

**4. $N$-Collatz Sum (2022.10.25; open)**
<br/>
If we assign $\pm$ to all elements of a Collatz sequence, i.e.
$S(1)=1$,
$S(2)=2-1$,
$S(3)=3-10+5+16-8-4-2+1$,
$S(4)=4-2-1$,
$S(5)=5-16+8+4-2+1$, ...,
is it true that $\min(|S(n)|)\leq{1}$ always hold?  
<strong> Comment </strong>
<br/>
This is verified to be true for $n\leq{10^6}$.
