## Number Theory
1. Denote $n$ as the n-th repeated exponential of an integer, i.e., $a_3=a^{a^{a}}$. Is there more prime in the form $p_n=3^{3^{3^{.^{.^{.}}}}}+2^{2^{2^{.^{.^{.}}}}}$, other than $p_1$, $p_2$, and $p_3$?

<strong> Answer </strong>
<br/>
No, the frist three are the only primes in such a sequence.
<br/>
For $n=4$, we have $p_4$ divides $21219553216129$.

<br/>
For $n\geq{4}$, we have $p_5$ divides $34276387$, and $p_6$ or greater divides $4423$.
