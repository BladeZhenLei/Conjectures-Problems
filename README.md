<br/>
Denote the tetration of an integer as ${^{n}a}=a^{a^{a^{.^{.^{.}}}}}$ where $a$ is present $n$ times. Is there more prime in the form $p_n={^{n}2}+{^{n}3}=3^{3^{3^{.^{.^{.}}}}}+2^{2^{2^{.^{.^{.}}}}}$, other than $p_1$, $p_2$, and $p_3$?
<p/>
<strong> Answer </strong>
<br/>
No, the frist three are the only primes in such pattern.
<br/>
For $n=4$, we have $p_4$ divides $21219553216129$.

<br/>
For $n\geq{4}$, we have $p_5$ divides $34276387$, and in general, $p_6$ or greater divides $4423$.

**2. (2022.10.9; open)** 
<br/>
For any integer $n\geq{1}$, is there always a prime that can be obtained from combinations of addition and subtraction of all elements in the set $\lbrace{1!, 2!, 3!, â€¦, n!}\rbrace$? 
Such as
$p_1={1!}\pm{0!},$
$p_2={2!}\pm{1!},$
$p_3={3!}\pm{2!}\pm{1!},$
$\cdots,$
$p_n=n!\pm(n-1)!\pm(n-2)!\pm(n-3)!\pm\cdot\cdot\cdot\pm{1!}.$
<p/>
<strong> Answer </strong>
<br/>
This statement reamins true for $p_{1}$ to $p_{257}$ and likely to be true for all positive integers considering the prime density.

<br/>
For all ${n}\geq{k}\geq{1}$, can we always find a prime of form ${n!}\pm{k!}\pm{1!}$?
<p/>
<strong> Answer </strong>
<br/>
No. The counter examples appeared at $n=63$, $n=161$, and $n=382$ for $n\leq642$.
