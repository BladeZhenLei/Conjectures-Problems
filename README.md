$1.$ (2022.1.19; solved)
<br/>
Denote the tetration of an integer as ${^{n}a}=a^{a^{a^{.^{.^{.}}}}}$ where $a$ is present $n$ times. Is there more prime in the form $p_n={^{n}2}+{^{n}3}=3^{3^{3^{.^{.^{.}}}}}+2^{2^{2^{.^{.^{.}}}}}$, other than $p_1$, $p_2$, and $p_3$? (2022.1.19)
<p/>
<strong> Answer </strong>
<br/>
No, the frist three are the only primes in such pattern.
<br/>
For $n=4$, we have $p_4$ divides $21219553216129$.

<br/>
For $n\geq{4}$, we have $p_5$ divides $34276387$, and in general, $p_6$ or greater divides $4423$.

$2.$ (2022.10.9; open) 
<br/>
For any integer $n\geq2$, is there always a prime that can be obtained from combinations of addition and subtraction of all elements in the set $\lbrace{1!, 2!, 3!, â€¦, n!}\rbrace$.
Such as
$$2!+1!$$
$$3!+2!-1!$$
$$4!+3!+2!-1!$$
$$5!+4!+3!+2!-1!$$
$$6!-5!+4!+3!+2!-1!$$
$$7!-6!-5!+4!+3!+2!-1!$$
$$8!-7!+6!-5!-4!-3!+2!-1!$$
$$9!+8!-7!+6!-5!-4!-3!+2!-1!$$
$$10!-9!+8!-7!+6!-5!+4!-3!+2!-1!$$
$$11!+10!+9!-8!-7!+6!+5!-4!-3!+2!-1!$$ 
$$12!+11!+10!-9!+8!+7!+6!+5!-4!+3!+2!-1!$$ 
$${13!-12!+11!+10!+9!-8!-7!+6!+5!-4!-3!-2!+1!}$$
